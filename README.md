### Description
Our analysis delved into a vast video game dataset comprising 6,900 entries, seeking the essence of a game's success. Leveraging models like KNN and SVM, we predicted sales categories using R. Our focus was deciphering the factors shaping game triumph, unraveling associations between game attributes and sales. This exploration through classification algorithms aimed to unearth pivotal predictors, illuminating the path to game success.
